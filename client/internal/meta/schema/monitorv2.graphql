MonitorV2RollupStatus is a convenience indicator of how to perceive the state of the monitor.

encapsultes those inspections into a single priority-based status.
Some status indicators are not exclusive with others so, for example, a monitor that is "Triggering"
may also be "Degraded" because of underlying warnings.
This priority-sorted rollup is just to let the user prioritize and sort things in the UI in an order
we define as most sensible. This ordering can be changed as needed.
In descending order of priority, the values are:
 - Inactive: The monitor is not running because it is disabled or because the system has deactivated it due to chronic failures.
 - Failed: The last attempt to run the monitor had fatal errors (it cannot trigger).
 - Triggering: The last evaluation had still-active alarms, or new one-shot alarms.
 - Degraded: The last evaluation had warnings, but evaluation completed and no alarms were detected.
 - Running: The default state. If no other status is indicated, the monitor is running.
