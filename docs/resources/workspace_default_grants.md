# observe_workspace_default_grants

Manages the workspace default grants for newly created resources.
Only one of this resource can exist in a given tenant.
## Example Usage
```terraform
data "observe_rbac_group" "engineering" {
  name = "engineering"
}

data "observe_rbac_group" "readonly" {
  name = "readonly"
}

// Note: Below there are 3 different examples of how policies could be configured using
// observe_workspace_default_grants as a demonstration, but only one resource of this type
// is allowed in a given tenant.

// Allow group "engineering" to edit and group "readonly" to view newly created resources by default.
resource "observe_workspace_default_grants" "example" {
  group {
    oid        = data.observe_rbac_group.engineering.oid
    permission = "edit"
  }

  group {
    oid        = data.observe_rbac_group.readonly.oid
    permission = "view"
  }
}

// Only the creating user (and admins) can edit newly created resources by default.
resource "observe_workspace_default_grants" "empty" {}

// Allow group "engineering" to edit newly created dashboards and worksheets by default, but only
// view datastreams. Allow group "readonly" to still view all newly created resources by default.
resource "observe_workspace_default_grants" "limited" {
  group {
    oid          = data.observe_rbac_group.engineering.oid
    permission   = "edit"
    object_types = ["dashboard", "worksheet"]
  }

  group {
    oid          = data.observe_rbac_group.engineering.oid
    permission   = "view"
    object_types = ["datastream"]
  }

  group {
    oid        = data.observe_rbac_group.readonly.oid
    permission = "view"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `group` (Block Set) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--group))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--group"></a>
### Nested Schema for `group`

Required:

- `oid` (String) The Observe ID for the group to grant access to.
- `permission` (String) The permission to grant. Must be one of `view` or `edit`.

Optional:

- `object_types` (List of String) Limits which object types this default grant applies to. Must be one of
`dashboard`, `datastream` or `worksheet`. If not set, this default grant applies
to all object types. Note: Datasets and monitors are not represented here as
they inherit default grants based on their input datasets instead.
