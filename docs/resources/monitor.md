## Schema

### Required

- `inputs` (Map of String) The inputs map binds dataset OIDs to labels which can be referenced within
stage pipelines.
- `name` (String) Monitor name. Must be unique within workspace.
- `rule` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rule))
- `stage` (Block List, Min: 1) A stage processes an input according to the provided pipeline. If no
input is provided, a stage will implicitly follow on from the result of
its predecessor. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--stage))
- `workspace` (String) OID of the workspace this object is contained in.

### Optional

- `comment` (String) A long-form comment describing the content of the monitor.
- `definition` (String) Monitor definition in JSON format.
- `description` (String) A brief description of the monitor.
- `disabled` (Boolean) Set to `true` to disable monitor.
- `freshness` (String) Target freshness for results. Reducing the freshness will increase the
frequency with which queries are run, which incurs higher transform costs.
- `icon_url` (String) Icon to be displayed for this object. Icons are sourced from the [fluency-filled](https://icons8.com/icons/fluency-systems-filled) icon set.
- `is_template` (Boolean) This resource is template for creating new monitors
- `notification_spec` (Block List, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--notification_spec))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `oid` (String) OID (Observe ID) for this object. This is the canonical identifier that
should be used when referring to this object in terraform manifests.

- `source_column` (String)
- `threshold` (Block List, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rule--threshold))
