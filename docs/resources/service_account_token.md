# observe_service_account_token

Manages an API token for a service account. The token can be used to authenticate with the Observe API as the service account.

~> **NOTE:** When a token expires, Observe automatically deletes it. This resource will NOT recreate deleted tokens automatically; instead, a warning is emitted during refresh.
## Example Usage
```terraform
# Create a service account
resource "observe_service_account" "automation" {
  label       = "automation-service-account"
  description = "Service account for automated API access"
  disabled    = false
}

# Create a short-lived API token for the service account with 1-hour lifetime
resource "observe_service_account_token" "short_lived" {
  service_account = observe_service_account.automation.oid
  label           = "short-lived-token"
  description     = "Temporary API token"
  lifetime_hours  = 1
  disabled        = false
}

# Create a long-lived API token (365 days)
resource "observe_service_account_token" "long_lived" {
  service_account = observe_service_account.automation.oid
  label           = "long-lived-token"
  description     = "API token for long-running integrations"
  lifetime_hours  = 8760 # 365 days
  disabled        = false
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `label` (String) A label for the API token.
- `lifetime_hours` (Number) The requested token lifetime in hours.
- `service_account` (String) ID of the service account this token belongs to.

### Optional

- `description` (String) Optional description for the API token.
- `disabled` (Boolean) Whether the API token is disabled. Defaults to `false`.

### Read-Only

- `expiration` (String) Expiration timestamp (RFC3339) when the token will expire.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `secret` (String, Sensitive) The API token secret used to authenticate with the Observe API. **NOTE:** This value will be stored in the raw state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/sensitive-data.html).
## Import
Import is supported using the following syntax:
```shell
# Import a service account token using the composite ID format: <service_account_id>/<token_id>
# The service account ID is the numeric ID from the service account
# The token ID is the unique identifier for the token
terraform import observe_service_account_token.example 12345/token-abc-123

# Set SECRET environment variable to import with the token secret
# Otherwise, because token secrets cannot be read from the API, it will be null
SECRET=the-token-secret terraform import observe_service_account_token.example 12345/token-abc-123
```
