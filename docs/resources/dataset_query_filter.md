# observe_dataset_query_filter

Query-time filter that can be applied to a specific dataset. Useful for quickly making sensitive data un-queryable
by users after noticing a leak, before preventing ingestion of that data at the source.
## Example Usage
```terraform
data "observe_workspace" "default" {
  name = "Default"
}

data "observe_dataset" "example" {
  workspace = data.observe_workspace.default.oid
  name      = "Example Dataset"
}

resource "observe_dataset_query_filter" "example" {
  dataset     = data.observe_dataset.example.oid
  label       = "PII Filter"
  description = "Filter to exclude rows containing personally identifiable information"
  filter      = "body ~ <phoneNumber> and body ~ <emailAddress>"
  disabled    = false
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `dataset` (String) The OID of the dataset this query filter applies to.
- `filter` (String) OPAL boolean expression string for the filter. For example, `body ~ "phoneNumber"`.
This is an exclusion filter, so all observations matching the filter will be filtered out.
- `label` (String) Human-readable name for the filter.

### Optional

- `description` (String) Long-form description of the filter.
- `disabled` (Boolean) Whether the filter is disabled by the user.

### Read-Only

- `errors` (List of String) List of error messages if the filter cannot be applied.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `oid` (String) OID (Observe ID) for this object. This is the canonical identifier that
should be used when referring to this object in terraform manifests.
