# observe_dataset (Data Source)





<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- **workspace** (String) OID of workspace dataset is contained in.

### Optional

- **id** (String) Dataset ID. Either `name` or `id` must be provided.
- **name** (String) Dataset name. Must be unique within workspace.

### Read-Only

- **description** (String) Dataset description.
- **freshness** (String) Target freshness for dataset. This impacts how frequently the dataset query will be run.
- **icon_url** (String) Icon image.
- **inputs** (Map of String) The inputs map binds dataset OIDs to labels which can be referenced within stage pipelines.
- **oid** (String) The Observe ID for dataset.
- **path_cost** (Number) Path cost is used to weigh graph link computation.
- **stage** (Block List) Each stage processes an input according to the provided pipeline. If no input is provided, a stage will implicitly follow on from the result of its predecessor. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--stage))

### Nested Schema for `stage`

Read-Only:

- **alias** (String) The stage alias is the label by which subsequent stages can refer to the results of this stage.
- **input** (String) The stage input defines what input should be used as a starting point for the stage pipeline. It must refer to a label contained in `inputs`, or a previous stage `alias`. The stage input can be omitted if a dataset has a single input.
- **pipeline** (String) An OPAL snippet defining a transformation on the selected input.
