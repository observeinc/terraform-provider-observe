# observe_dataset (Data Source)





<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `id` (String) Dataset ID. Either `name` or `id` must be provided.
- `name` (String) Dataset name. Must be unique within workspace.
- `workspace` (String) OID of workspace dataset is contained in.

### Read-Only

- `description` (String) Dataset description.
- `freshness` (String) Target freshness for dataset. This impacts how frequently the dataset query will be run.
- `icon_url` (String) Icon image.
- `inputs` (Map of String) The inputs map binds dataset OIDs to labels which can be referenced within stage pipelines.
- `oid` (String) The Observe ID for dataset.
- `on_demand_materialization_length` (String) The maximum on-demand materialization length for the dataset, in nanoseconds. If unset, the default value in the transformer config will be used instead.
- `path_cost` (Number) Path cost is used to weigh graph link computation.
- `stage` (Block List) Each stage processes an input according to the provided pipeline. If no input is provided, a stage will implicitly follow on from the result of its predecessor. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--stage))

### Nested Schema for `stage`

Read-Only:

- `alias` (String) The stage alias is the label by which subsequent stages can refer to the results of this stage.
- `input` (String) The stage input defines what input should be used as a starting point for the stage pipeline. It must refer to a label contained in `inputs`, or a previous stage `alias`. The stage input can be omitted if a dataset has a single input.
- `pipeline` (String) An OPAL snippet defining a transformation on the selected input.
