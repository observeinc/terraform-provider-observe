    Dataset name. Must be unique within workspace.
  description: |
    Dataset description.
  path_cost: |
    Path cost incurred by this dataset when computing graph link. Increasing
    this value will reduce the preference for using this dataset when computing
    paths between two datasets.
  on_demand_materialization_length: |
    The maximum on-demand materialization length for the dataset.
  acceleration_disabled: |
    Disables periodic materialization of the dataset
  acceleration_disabled_source: |
    Source of disabled materialization
  data_table_view_state: |
    JSON representation of state used for dataset formatting in the UI. Not intended to be configured by hand, please use export functionality.
  correlation_tag:
    description: |
      Correlation tags associated with this dataset.
  rematerialization_mode: |
    Specifies rematerialization mode when updating a dataset. Options include
    "rematerialize" (default), "skip_rematerialization", and "must_skip_rematerialization".
    "skip_rematerialization" will skip rematerialization if certain conditions are met, will rematerialize otherwise.
    "must_skip_rematerialization" will never rematerialize, update will fail if skipping rematerialization is not possible.
