# description:
#   Monitors provide a flexible way to alert for patterns in your
#   incoming data. A monitor executes a query periodically and applies rules to
#   determine whether to trigger notifications. Notifications are forwarded to
#   subscribed channels, which in turn route notifications to configured channel
#   actions.
