description: |
  Monitors provide a configurable way to alert when conditions about incoming data
  are matched. These alerts can optionally also be forwarded to notification receivers
  like email and webhooks using shared or single-monitor actions to configure the
  template and destinations to configure the receiver.

schema:
  workspace: |
    OID of the workspace this object is contained in.
  comment: |
    A longer description of the monitor. This can include details like how to resolve the issue, links to runbooks, etc.
  rule_kind: |
    Describes the type of each of the rules in the definition (they must all be the same type).
  name: |
    Monitor name.
  icon_url: |
    URL of the monitor icon.
  description: |
    A brief description of the monitor.
  disabled: |
    Enable/Disable the monitor (and any underlying transforms).
  no_data_rules:
    description: |
      No data rules allows a user to be alerted on missing data for the specified lookback window. When provided, the severity is fixed to the NoData severity. As of today, the max number of no data rules that can be created is 1 for the threshold monitor kind.
    expiration: |
      Allows for the user to specify how long they'd like the missing data alert to persist for before it resolves by itself. If not provided, the default expiration time will be set to 24 hours. The expiration must be identical across all rules.
    threshold:
      description: |
        Adds the ability for threshold monitor to have a no data rule. When this input is provided here, you must provide the aggregation and valueColumnName, while the compareGroups is optional. The compareValues should be left empty. The aggregation and value column provided must be identical across all rules.
      aggregation: |
        The query aggregator (AllOf, AnyOf, AvgOf, SumOf) for the value monitor type.
      value_column_name: |
        Indicates which column in the input query has the value to apply the aggregation.
  rules:
    description: |
      All rules for this monitor must be of the same MonitorRuleKind as specified in ruleKind. Rules should be constructed logically such that a state transition null->Warning implies transition from null->Informational.
    level: |
      The alarm level (Critical, Error, Informational, None, Warning).
    count: |
      The count rule to apply to incoming data.
    threshold:
      description: |
        Gives flexibility for threshold and range-based monitors to trigger on values. To look for sustained behavior (CPU > 80 for 5 mins), specify lookbackTime.
      value_column_name: |
        Indicates which column in the input query has the value to apply the aggregation.
      aggregation: |
        The query aggregator (AllOf, AnyOf, AvgOf, SumOf) for the value monitor type.
    promote: |
      The monitor will promote each event in the raw input dataset into an alert. For now, the promote rule will ignore link columns and only care about columnWithPath.
      If multiple compareColumns are specified in one promote rule, it will act as an AND condition. When defined through separate promote rules, it will act as an OR condition.
  lookback_time: |
    optionally describes a duration that must be satisifed by this monitor. It applies to all rules, but is only applicable to rule kinds that utilize it.
  data_stabilization_delay: |
    expresses the minimum time that should elapse before data is considered "good enough" to evaluate. Choosing a delay really depends on the expectations of latency of data and whether data is expected to arrive later than other data and thus would change previously evaluated results.
  max_alerts_per_hour: |
    overrides the default value of max alerts generated in a single hour before the monitor is deactivated for safety
  groupings: |
    Describes the groups that logically separate events/rows/etc from each other. If monitor dataset is resource type and monitor strategy is promote, this field should be either empty or only contain the primary keys of the dataset.
  scheduling:
    description: |
      Holds information about when the monitor should evaluate. The types of scheduling (interval, transform) are exclusive. If ommitted, defaults to transform.
    interval:
      description: |
        Should be used to run explicit ad-hoc queries.
      interval: |
        How often the monitor should attempt to run.
      randomize: |
        A maximum +/- to apply to the interval to avoid things like harmonics and work stacking up in parallel.
    transform:
      description: |
        Should be used to defer scheduling to the transformer and evaluate when data becomes available.
      freshness_goal: |
        The freshness goal.
    scheduled:
      description: |
        Should be specified to get wall-clock scheduled evaluation.
      raw_cron: |
        If specified, the raw cron is a crontab configuration to use to drive the scheduling.
      timezone: |
        A timezone is required to ensure that interpretation of scheduling on the wall-clock
        is done relative to the desired timezone.
  compare_values: |
    list of comparisons that provide an implicit AND where all comparisons must match.
  compare_groups: |
    list of comparisons made against the columns which the monitor is grouped by.
  column_path:
    description: |
      Specifies how the user wants to group by a specific column name or a JSON object column that has a path.
    name: |
      The name of the column.
    path: |
      The path of the path, if the name refers to a column with a JSON object.
  link_column:
    description: |
      Identifies a link-type column created by connecting two different datasets' columns (primary sources & destination sources).
    name: |
      The name of the link column.
  comparison:
    compare_fn: |
      the type of comparison (greater, less, equal, etc.)
    value_int64: |
      list of size <=1 consisting of an integer value.
    value_float64: |
      list of size <=1 consisting of a float value.
    value_bool: |
      list of size <=1 consisting of a boolean value.
    value_string: |
      list of size <=1 consisting of a string value.
    value_duration: |
      list of size <=1 consisting of a duration value.
    value_timestamp: |
      list of size <=1 consisting of a timestamp value.
  column:
    description: |
      Represents two possible column types (link column, columnPath) of an observe dataset.
  column_comparison:
    description: |
      Specifies the one or multiple values you'd like to compare against the column.
  actions:
    description: |
      The list of shared actions to which this monitor is connected.
    oid: |
      The OID of this shared action. This should be used for existing shared actions.
    action: |
      This value should be used for creating inline private actions.
    levels: |
      The alarm level(s) at which this monitor should trigger this shared action.
    conditions:
      description: |
        Optional conditions that can be AND'd with levels to match the action.
      compare_terms:
        description: |
          The column and value expression to consider (implied AND)
        comparison:

    send_end_notifications: |
      If true, notifications will be sent if the monitor stops triggering.
    send_reminders_interval: |
      Determines how frequently you will be reminded of an ongoing alert.
