schema:
  freshness: |
    Target freshness for results. Reducing the freshness will increase the
    frequency with which queries are run, which incurs higher transform costs.
  inputs: |
    The inputs map binds dataset OIDs to labels which can be referenced within
    stage pipelines.
  stage:
    description: |
      A stage processes an input according to the provided pipeline. If no
      input is provided, a stage will implicitly follow on from the result of
      its predecessor.
    alias: |
      The stage alias is the label by which subsequent stages can refer to the
      results of this stage.
    input: |
      The stage input defines what input should be used as a starting point for
      the stage pipeline. It must refer to a label contained in `inputs`, or a
      previous stage `alias`. The stage input can be omitted if `inputs`
      contains a single element.
    pipeline: |
      An OPAL snippet defining a transformation on the selected input.
    output_stage: |
      A boolean flag used to specify the output stage. Should be used only for
      a stage preceding the last stage. The last stage is an output stage by default.
