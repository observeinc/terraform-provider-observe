  A correlation tag can be attached to columns of a dataset. These tags are later used to correlate multiple datasets.
schema:
  dataset: |
    OID of the dataset to which the correlation tag should be attached.
  tag: |
    The tag to attach.
  column: |
    The column to which the correlation tag should be attached.
  path: |
    If the column is of type "object", a correlation tag can be attached to a
    key nested within the object. Standard Javascript notation can be used to specify the path to the key.
    For example, say the object has the following structure -
    {
      "a": {
        "b": {
          "c": "value"
        }
      }
    }
    Then the path to the key "c" would be "a.b.c" or "a['b']['c']"
