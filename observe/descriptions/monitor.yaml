description:
  Monitors provide a flexible way to alert for patterns in your
  incoming data. A monitor executes a query periodically and applies rules to
  determine whether to trigger notifications. Notifications are forwarded to
  subscribed channels, which in turn route notifications to configured channel
  actions.

      facet_values: |
        The values to compare the field against.
      time_function: |
        Temporal condition to evaluate the matches against (e.g. "at least once in window")

        Time window to evalute time_function over.
    threshold:
      description: |

      compare_function: |
        Comparison function used to compare the query result against the compare_values.
      compare_values: |
        Value(s) to compare the query(ies) against.
      lookback_time: |

    promotion:
      description: |
        Send an alert whenever there's a new resource, event, or interval in a dataset.
